# When use "to do" or "to be"
---
The first one means that someone is taking an action, on the other hand "to be" indicate the existence of a thing/someone.

If we create a questione we should follow this rule for the verb **to be**:
>[!quote] **Rule to follow**
>*WH*[^4] + **to be** + subject +  age
>					 verb + ing form
>					 adjective
>					 noun
>					 preposition
>					 adverb
>					 location

- ***Is** he arriving at the house?*
- *"What **is** the best thing you have in your house?"*
- *"Where **is** he from?"*
- "What ***are*** you doing?"

So is relevant to evidence that "**to do**" as an auxiliary verb is it used when we have a different main verb in the present/past sentence.
e.g:

- *"Do you ==agree== with Leo, about going to Lisbon this weekend?"*
- *"I don't ==want== to buy this toy for my son."*
- *"Do you ==know== this man?"*

# Preposition 
---
We use preposition when we are talking about relationship about time, space or logical connection, between two or more people, places or thing. Many of the preposition are nearby to a noun phrase or pronoun.

-  _The last time I saw him he was walking **down** the road._
- _I’ll meet you in the cafe **opposite** the cinema._
- _It was difficult to sleep **during** the flight._
- _It was the worst storm **since** the 1980s._
- _Give that **to** me._

❌ *envrionment*  /  ✅  **environment** 

❌ *recive* /  ✅ **receive**


❌ *Nevertheless... in the other hand* /  ✅ **However.... on the other hand**
- Nevertheless is not correct and it's better to use **However** with **on the other hand**

*set up* is used for systems and components, **established**  is more related about rules and conditions.

| if predators can’t see straight through the glass frogs, *how about* they have evolved in this way? | if predators can’t see straight through the glass frogs,  **how come** they have evolved in this way? |
Because in the first one, means that we are suggesting something to do, like: *how about going out tonight?*, the second one means **why** they did like this or that.

| decided to *spent* / instead of *stay* | decide to **spend** / instead of **staying** |
In the first example there's always a base form verb after **decide to**, so the rule is:
>[!quote] decide to + [base form verb]

While **instead of** is always followed by a **ing form verb**, for example:
- Jack is watching TV **instead of working** for his new project.
- Davide and Julia have been in the Library last weekend, **instead of going** to the concert they plant to go.

# How learn new words in english
---
The fact is that you can collect words in you bag, but you are not going to remember all of them, just because they are in the bag and you are not using them at all.
So how can you improve your language skill? How can we memorize the words we have learnt during our study session?

There are three points that we are going to discuss all of them later:
- [[#Discover a new word|Discover]]
- [[#Practise|Practise]]
- [[#Rewiev|Review]]

## Discover a new word

Discover a new word means that we need to know the **personality** of a word, so for example if a word is a (noun, verb, adjective or an adverb), its sound and is friend, collocation with other words, so the word is going together.

So that does it mean that the vocabulary you are going to learn, need to be specified in a context and either to be like a detective so search the word that is common in use and find out the meaning of it, using the **dictionary** , for example the [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/) one, and find out the word that you want to know.

## Practice 

After wrote the word in your notebook or book, just try to practice, for example, using them in the speaking part, or just use them when you want to write the essay or furthermore you can use all of them during your study session.

For example, let's see a new word that we learnt in the discovery part, in this case we are going to use the verb *to abide* , let's create the sentence with this verb.

> *I can't abide anymore my mum, she is used to annoying me with her new job*

Now form this sentence we can change the noun, the subject and the person, the context we are referring to, we can change the subject.

> *He can't abide anymore his mum, she is used to annoying him with her new job*

Or the person/context we are pointing to.

>*You cannot abide your **brother** anymore, he is used to annoying you with **his** new job.*

And so on, we can change all we want, but the most important concept, that we should keep in mind is that, **WE NEED TO PRACTISE**.

## Review

The review part means that we need to receive feedback from the peoples around us, for example, a teacher, a native speaker or a friend, in the last case we need to ask him, if we told the work in the right way or not.
 
# Reading and use of English
---
## aspect vs feature
For describe a characteristic of a thing, person or an animal we use **feature** not *aspect*, that is used for abstract ideas.

>[!done] **Frase corretta**
>This unusual **feature** of the frog that had led to an intriguing question.

> [!error] Frase sbagliata
> This unusual **aspect** of the frog that had led to an intriguing question.

**aspect** is it a noun and it's use when we emphasize a part of something (that in this case is abstract), for example:
- We are gonna talk about the **aspect** of being vegetarian or not.
- His illness is an **aspect** that we should consider it important.

## at the end vs in the end
Both of them are grammatically correct, but the first one is used with an object at the end, for instance:
>[!example] **Example of "at the end"**
>The will finish the project *at the end* **of the day**.
>

As you can see here, we add the object **of the day**, to refer something is going to finish in a specific period of time.

On the other hand **in the end**, we can use it without any object after.
>[!example] **Example of "in the end"** 
>**In the end**, we have not enough time to finish it.
## by vs from

In a [passive voice](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zkttng8#zyrw8hv) we use the for **by** when we want to indicate that (something **is done by someone/something**), that's useful for us to indicate who or what performe that action.

We use **from** when we are referring about the distance from an object to the other one, for example we are going to use it.

- We could see the vocalist **from** where we sat..
- My house is far **from** the mall.
- There is a great view **from** her apartment's window.

> [!info] **Passive voice form**
> The passive voice form is compose like that.
> 
> **be + past participle** +  if needed a preposition
> 
> verbo essere (da coniugare) + participio passato

# Phrasal verbs general
---
There are different types of phrasal verbs, but first and foremost, we are gonna look the skeleton of a phrasal verb.
> [!quote] **How is form the phrasal verb?**
> *verb* + **preposition/adverb
> 
>for instance we can say:
> *turn* + **off**

We can say that a phrasal verb is categorize in:
- [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|Separable]]
- [[#Unseparable Phrasal Verb|inseparable]]
- [[#Transitive Verb|Transitive]]
- [[#Intransitive Verb|Intransitive]]
## Separable Phrasal Verb
These one are phrasal verb where we can put an object in the middle of the *verb* and **preposition/adverb**, as an example:

*turn* **off** -> mean to stop the energy power from a device.

We can separate the *verb* and the **adverb** and put the object:
- I cant *turn* **off** ==the tv==.
- I cant turn ==the tv== off.
>[!important] **Important rule we must follow**
>We cannot put an [[#Object pronouns|object pronoun]] after a separable verb, for instance, we cannot use the object pronoun like this:
>- I cant turn off **it**
> Instead we need to say:
> - I cant turn **it** off

## Inseparable Phrasal Verb
It's the opposite of the separable one, we cannot separate the *verb* with the **adjective/preposition**, as for example the phrasal verb:

*came* **across** -> means if we find something accidentally/ without looking for it.

We **CANNOT** separate the *verb* with the **adverb/preposition**:
✅ - I came across to ==an old photo==.
❌ - I came ==an old photo== across.

## Transitive Verb
We can apply this rule to all of the verb we are going to encounter during our study session, these verb must require at the of the them an **OBJECT**, they need to refer.

For example the phrasal verb:

*turn* **on** -> to give power/energy to a device 

We CANNOT say for example:
❌ - I turn on ... (we must put the object we are refer to)
✅ - I turn on ==the tv== (the object is ==the tv==)

## Intransitive Verb
Verb that doesn't require an object to make it sense, but they can be understood by itself:
- I **am sitting** (sitting is intransitive bc we understand the action).
- I **am eating** (This one it could be [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]] or intransitive, means that we can put an object after it or not).
>[!important] **Intransitive Phrasal Verb**
>All the phrasal verbs that are Inseparable, they are either intransitive.

As an example we can say: 
*come* **over** -> coming to a specific place, is inseparable and intransitive

*turn* **up** -> this phrasal verb could be [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]] and [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|separble]] in this meaning we are refer to high the level of something, as an example:
- *Turn* the volume **up**
However it could be possible that turn up is intransitive and inseparable, and it change the meaning. from the one we said before to ==say when someone is coming unexpectedly==, for instance:
- I will *turn* **up** tomorrow.

## Phrasal Verb with "Turn"
*turn* **up** 
- increase volume.  [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|separable]] and [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]]
- to appear or arrive, often unexpectedly here is. [[#Intransitive Verb|intransitive]] and  [[#Inseparable Phrasal Verb|inseparable]].
*turn* **down**
- decrease volume / reduce volume  [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|separable]] and [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]].
- reject an offer or an invitation here is  [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|separable]] and [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]].
*turn* **on**
- give electricity do devices  [[#Separable Phrasal Verb|separable]] and [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]]
- begin aggressive physically or verbally, here is [[#Transitive Verb|transitive]]  and [[#Inseparable Phrasal Verb|inseparable]].

# Grammar basics
---
Here a list of all the basics concept we are used to use in english, but mostly we are using them wrongly.

## Preposition IN vs AT for places

**AT**: we use it when we are talking ==about small places==, insignificant places, like for example we can say:
- Let's see each other **at** the restaurant in 20 minutes. 
- I will be **at** the cinema in 1 hour.
  
**IN**: we use **in** when we want to talk about big places, like Country, Region, City ecc..., let's say for example:
- I have been **in** London for 5 years.
- Ilaria lives **in** Italy, to be honest, I don't know where exactly.

## IN vs ON vs AT (for time measurements)

**IN**: we use **in** to indicate that an action is going to be completed, in a specific measurement of time:
- See you **in** 20 minutes.
- I will go to the gym **in** 2 hours, now I need to study for the exam.

Besides, we can use **in** , when we specify the year, as an example:
- My dad born in Los Angeles **in** 1985.
- The film that we are going to see tonight, it is establish in 1939, before the WW2 . 

**ON** and **AT**: we can use both of them when we are specifying the time and the date, for instance:
- I will see you **on**  Monday **at**  12:00 PM.
- The English class is going to start **on** January.

## BESIDES vs BESIDE

**BESIDE**: [[#Preposition|preposition]] that's means nearby, when something or someone in near to us.
- We were camping beside the river.
- I was studying beside this beautiful garden. 

**BESIDES**: is an adverb that means in addition to,  we can use it as a phrase starter, for instance:
- **BESIDES** we need your support in this venture.
- **BESIDES** two suitcase, I'm taking three boxes with me.
## ALL OF vs ALL

**ALL OF**: we use it before [[#Object pronouns|object pronouns]], so we are going to use them every time before the object pronoun.
- All of us need to complete the questionnaire.
- I thought that all of them finished the CAE before me.

**ALL**: we use is in all the other cases, where we don't need to put an object pronoun before of it, in all the other cases.
## ABOUT TO vs DUE/SCHEDULE TO

**ABOUT TO**: we use it when something is happening in a restricted fraction of time, it's imminent, it's about to happen within few second, for example:
- The teacher **is about** to give to all of us a task.
- I am **about to** hit my self.

**DUE/SCHEDULE TO:** we use it when something has been plan since a long period of time, and cannot be changed, for instance:
- The train is **schedule/due to** leave 10:30 AM.
- The train is **due to leave** in 5 minutes.
# Advise to pass the exam
My recommendations: „
- Google “CAE Use of English practice tests” and use the website “engexam.info” to practice reading and Use of English 
- Watch the videos of teacher phill about the writing part - Watch the video “CAE – Writing an Essay (I write a C1 Advanced Essay!)” by CAEexamtips
- Watch some videos on how to succeed in the speaking part (e.g. by Oxford Online English)
- On the Cambridge website there is a sample test that you can download. The different parts of the exam are always the same so take good look at them.
- Try to get a good night's sleep the day before the exam and relax! I hope that this helps and good luck to anyone who is taking the test.
