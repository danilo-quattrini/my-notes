# 1.0 When use "to do" or "to be"
---
The first one means that someone is taking an action, on the other hand "to be" indicate the existence of a thing/someone.

So is relevant to evidence that "**to do**" as an helping verb is it used when we have a different main verb in the present/past sentence.
e.g:

- *"Do you ==agree== with Leo, about going to Lisbon this weekend?"*
- *"I don't ==want== to buy this toy for my son."*
- *"Do you ==know== this man?"*

# ❌ Errors I made & ✅ Correction

❌ *Into people's head*  / ✅ **In all people's mind**

❌ *Most of the adults nowadays* / ✅ **Nowadays many  adults** (because most is too broad[^1]).

❌ *To act  good*  / ✅ **Be a good person / role model**

❌ *envrionment*  /  ✅  **environment** 

❌ *set up* / ✅ **establish** (set up is used for systems and components, the second one is more related about rules and conditions).
