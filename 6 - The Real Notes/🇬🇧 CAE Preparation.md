# 1.0 When use "to do" or "to be"
---
The first one means that someone is taking an action, on the other hand "to be" indicate the existence of a thing/someone.

So is relevant to evidence that "**to do**" as an helping verb is it used when we have a different main verb in the present/past sentence.
e.g:

- *"Do you ==agree== with Leo, about going to Lisbon this weekend?"*
- *"I don't ==want== to buy this toy for my son."*
- *"Do you ==know== this man?"*

❌ *Into people's head*  / ✅ **In all people's mind**

❌ *Most of the adults nowadays* / ✅ **Nowadays many  adults** (because most is too broad[^1]).

❌ *To act good*  / ✅ **Be a good person / role model**

❌ *envrionment*  /  ✅  **environment** 

❌ *recive* /  ✅ **receive**

| ❌        | ✅               |

| *set up* |  **establish**  |
*set up* is used for systems and components, **established**  is more related about rules and conditions.

| if predators can’t see straight through the glass frogs, *how about* they have evolved in this way? | if predators can’t see straight through the glass frogs,  **how come** they have evolved in this way? |
Because in the first one, means that we are suggesting something to do, like: *how about going out tonight?*, the second one means **why** they did like this or that.


|                   ❌                   |                      ✅                      |

| decided to *spent* / instead of *stay* | decide to **spend** / instead of **staying** |
In the first example there's always a base form verb after **decide to**, so the rule is:
>[!quote] decide to + [base form verb]

While **instead of** is always followed by a **ing form verb**, for example:
- Jack is watching TV **instead of working** for his new project.
- Davide and Julia have been in the Library last weekend, **instead of going** to the concert they plant to go.
  
>[!quote] instead of + [base form verb] + **ing**

regardless means **despite of** that is not correct in this sentence, is better to say **rather than**[^2] because is more coherent to the context.

| ❌               | ✅                |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| *introduce for* | **Introduce to** |
We say when we are talking with someone, we are going to **introduce to** (smth), so we write **introduce** + **to**.

| ❌                | ✅               |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| *about the time* | **at the time** |

In that phrase is not referring about the time, it's talking about **at the time**(a quel tempo e non in riferimento al tempo).


# How learn new words in english
---
The fact is that you can collect words in you bag, but you are not going to remember all of them, just because they are in the bag and you are not using them at all.
So how can you improve your language skill? How can we memorize the words we have learnt during our study session?

There are three points that we are going to discuss all of them later:
- [[#Discover a new word|Discover]]
- [[#Practise|Practise]]
- [[#Rewiev|Review]]

## Discover a new word

Discover a new word means that we need to know the **personality** of a word, so for example if a word is a (noun, verb, adjective or an adverb), its sound and is friend, collocation with other words, so the word is going together.

So that does it mean that the vocabulary you are going to learn, need to be specified in a context and either to be like a detective so search the word that is common in use and find out the meaning of it, using the **dictionary** , for example the [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/) one, and find out the word that you want to know.

## Practise 

After wrote the word in your notebook or book, just try to practise, for example, using them in the speaking part, or just use them when you want to write the essay or furthermore you can use all of them during your study session.

For example, let's see a new word that we learnt in the discovery part, in this case we are going to use the verb *to abide* , let's create the sentence with this verb.

> *I can't abide anymore my mum, she is used to annoying me with her new job*

Now form this sentence we can change the noun, the subject and the person, the context we are referring to, we can change the subject.

> *He can't abide anymore his mum, she is used to annoying him with her new job*

Or the person/context we are pointing to.

>*You cannot abide your **brother** anymore, he is used to annoying you with **his** new job.*

And so on, we can change all we want, but the most important concept, that we should keep in mind is that, **WE NEED TO PRACTISE**.

## Rewiev

The review part means that we need to receive feedback from the peoples around us, for example, a teacher, a native speaker or a friend, in the last case we need to ask him, if we told the work in the right way or not.
 
# Reading and use of English
---
## aspect vs feature
For describe a characteristic of a thing, person or an animale we use **feature** not *aspect*, that is used for abstract ideas.

>[!done] **Frase corretta**
>This unusual **feature** of the frog that had led to an intriguing question.

> [!error] Frase sbagliata
> This unusual **aspect** of the frog that had led to an intriguing question.

**aspect** is it a noun and it's use when we emphasize a part of something (that in this case is abstract), for example:
- We are gonna talk about the **aspect** of being vegetarian or not.
- His illness is an **aspect** that we should consider it important.
## by vs from

In a [passive voice](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zkttng8#zyrw8hv) we use the for **by** when we want to indicate that (something **is done by someone/something**), that's useful for us to indicate who or what performe that action.

We use **from** when we are referring about the distance from an object to the other one, for example we are going to use it.

- We could see the vocalist **from** where we sat..
- My house is far **from** the mall.
- There is a great view **from** her apartment's window.

> [!info] **Passive voice form**
> The passive voice form is compose like that.
> 
> **be + past participle** +  if needed a preposition
> 
> verbo essere (da coniugare) + participio passato
