Creating a ps1 with some animation effects inside when you are open it.
![[PS1.jpeg]]
- Going inside the ps1, created the intro of something, make sound and images showing logo. of something, video no usable and appears 3d model.
- Room with child playing with it and creating a view of the kid playing and camera doing the moving through the old tv.
This is the retro place where we should place the kid inside this room [kid room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6M0dfcGb9U) create a game start make a game, and make people play at the game,.
- Mini model moving around the space, move the character with kinect?

Creating gta word and **shooting with phones**.

Using the phone for moving **around the space**

Changing of game if u watch some places, and also maybe to try to go inside the ps1 with the eyes.
Touching the ps1 and changing the walls or like a video game starting it and changing the wall, scary stuff with room and jump scare.

## Final idea

Creating the kid room with the ps1,  video for of the wall, when pressing the ps1 a transition that's scratch like a paper and go into a word backroom
**which material we should use?**

**Neonia museum** 

- what we should use for interact with the room kineck, phone, controller or other stuff

We are going to choose the second one for the main room and for the backroom the third one.
Phone for the touching part with sensor.

here u can find where the person watch the room 
![[Prospectiveview.jpg]]
The person is going to see the room and inside there are going to saw different wall with animation, and when is going to touch the ps1 is going to do something else.![[TheWall.jpg]]
These would be an idea of wall of the room, they are call paper cut banners
