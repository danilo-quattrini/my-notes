# University Notes 📚

Welcome to my repository of university notes, meticulously organized and managed with Obsidian v1.7.7. These notes cover all subjects and topics I have studied during my time at university.

## 📁 Directory Structure

The notes are categorized by courses, topics, or semesters, making it easy to navigate and locate specific content. Here’s the general structure:
```
1-Rough Notes/

├── 3-Tags/
│   ├── StudyTips.md

```
Key Features:
